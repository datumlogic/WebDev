				<h4>Left</h4>
				<p>	You can search throughout the entire universe for someone who is more deserving of your love and affection than you are yourself, and that person is not to be found anywhere. You yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe deserve your love and affection.</p>
			
				<p>A jug fills drop by drop, you, yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe, deserve your love and affection, better than a thousand hollow words, is one word that brings peace, virtue is persecuted more by the wicked than it is loved by the good. Do not overrate what you have received, nor envy others. He who envies others does not obtain peace of mind.</p>
			
				<p>Work out your own salvation. Do not depend on others, I do not believe in a fate that falls on men however they act; but I do believe in a fate that falls on them unless they act. We are shaped by our thoughts; we become what we think. When the mind is pure, joy follows like a shadow that never leaves.</p>

				<p>Chaos is inherent in all compounded things. Strive on with diligence, you, yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe, deserve your love and affection, to be idle is a short road to death and to be diligent is a way of life; foolish people are idle, wise people are diligent.</p>
